# Think Pair Share Questions for BIO 305 (Anatomy & Physiology III) 


### Lab 24 Digestive System 


1. Describe the structure and function of the intestinal villi.
2. What symptoms can arise from the loss of function of intestinal villi?
3. What is Crohn's disease? What are the symptoms?

4. Describe the structure and function of the muscularis externa in the intestines. 
5. What symptoms may arise if the muscularis externa in the intestines loses its function?
6. What is _Paralytic Ileus_? What are the symptoms?

7. Describe the structure and function of the pancreas. 
8. Explain three symptoms that may arise if the pancreas becomes inflamed.
9. What is _Pancreatitis_? What are the symptoms?

### Lab 21 Lymphatics and Immunity 


1. What regions of the body are drained by the lymphatic duct?
2. True/False. Mark the following statements as true (T) or false (F). 
    1. Vessels of the lymphatic system absorb dietary carbohydrates and deliver them to the blood. 
    2. The spleenâ€™s red pulp contains macrophages that destroy old or damaged erythrocytes. 
    3. B lymphocytes migrate to the thymus to mature. 
    4. Lymph nodes filter lymph and activate the immune system.
3. Tonsils are defined as
    5. Lymph nodes in the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx.
    6. Partially encapsulated clusters of mucosal-associated lymphatic tissue in the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx.
    7. Encapsulated cluster of mucosal-associated lymphatic tissue lining mucous membranes
    8. Lymph nodes lining mucous membranes
4. In the center of the lymphoid follicle is a __________, containing B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. 
5. What cell types are phagocytic? 
6. Explain the role of dendritic cells in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. In your response, describe how dendritic cells function in both immune responses, their role in antigen presentation, and their interaction with T cells to initiate adaptive immunity.
7. What is the main component of humoral immunity? 
8. Why do diseases that damage erythocytes tend to cause enlargement of the spleen? 
9. Four weeks ago, Melva underwent surgery to remove her cancerous right breast as well as all the axillary lymph nodes on the left side. She is now reporting extensive swelling in her upper left limb. What do you suspect is the cause of the swelling?
10. Juliet had her tonsils removed to alleviate recurring infections. A histological examination of the extracted tissue revealed deep tonsillar cysts. How does this help explain the recurring infections?
11. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can impair dendritic cell activity during the acute phase of the infection. How does this affect the immune response to SARS-CoV-2?
12. The drug ibuprofen blocks the production of inflammatory mediators, including pyrogens. Why does this make ibuprofen a good drug to treat fever?
