# Think Pair Share Questions for BIO 305 (Anatomy & Physiology III) 


### Lab 24 Digestive System 


1. Describe the structure and function of the intestinal villi.
2. What symptoms can arise from the loss of function of intestinal villi?
3. What is Crohn's disease? What are the symptoms?

4. Describe the structure and function of the muscularis externa in the intestines. 
5. What symptoms may arise if the muscularis externa in the intestines loses its function?
6. What is _Paralytic Ileus_? What are the symptoms?

7. Describe the structure and function of the pancreas. 
8. Explain three symptoms that may arise if the pancreas becomes inflamed.
9. What is _Pancreatitis_? What are the symptoms?

### Lab 21 Lymphatics and Immunity 


1. What regions of the body are drained by the lymphatic duct?
5. What cell types are phagocytic? 
6. Explain the role of dendritic cells in linking the innate and adaptive immune systems. In your response, describe how dendritic cells function in both immune responses, their role in antigen presentation, and their interaction with T cells to initiate adaptive immunity.
7. What is the main component of humoral immunity? 
8. Why do diseases that damage erythocytes tend to cause enlargement of the spleen? 
9. Four weeks ago, Melva underwent surgery to remove her cancerous right breast as well as all the axillary lymph nodes on the left side. She is now reporting extensive swelling in her upper left limb. What do you suspect is the cause of the swelling?
10. Juliet had her tonsils removed to alleviate recurring infections. A histological examination of the extracted tissue revealed deep tonsillar cysts. How does this help explain the recurring infections?
11. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can impair dendritic cell activity during the acute phase of the infection. How does this affect the immune response to SARS-CoV-2?
12. The drug ibuprofen blocks the production of inflammatory mediators, including pyrogens. Why does this make ibuprofen a good drug to treat fever?

### Group Project Presentations

1. What are the key functions of the __lymphatic system__, and how do these contribute to overall health? What diseases or disorders are associated with this system?
1. What are the key functions of the __reproductive system__, and how do these contribute to overall health and the continuation of the species? What diseases or disorders are associated with this system in males and females?
1. What are the key functions of the __respiratory system__, and how do these contribute to overall health? What diseases or disorders are associated with this system?
1. What are the key functions of the __urinary system__, and how do these contribute to overall health? What diseases or disorders are associated with this system?
1. How can you use AI ethically in BIO 205 to facilitate your learning without replacing critical thinking and problem-solving?
1. How can AI be used to enhance accessibility and inclusion in the biology classroom?
1. Is it ethical for AI to be used in grading or assessing students' work in biology? What potential benefits and drawbacks should be considered?
1. AI algorithms are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. What ethical implications could arise if an AI tool in a biology classroom is trained on biased or incomplete data?
