# Cultural Fluency Teaching Academy (CFTA) Portfolio


Hi! I'm Rayna. I was born in small town in east Texas with lakes and pine trees, but I now live in Alpine Meadows, a small town in Cali with lakes and pine trees. 
I have a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and a B.S in Biochemistry from The University of Texas at Austin. I've wanted to be a teacher for as long as I can remember (although I occasionally get side-tracked), and I 20 years of experience teaching science and technology. I am currently Adjunct Faculty Member in Biology and Chemistry at Lake Tahoe Community College, a yoga instructor with The Courage Project, Tahoe Flow Arts & Fitness, and Sugar Bowl Resort. I strive drive for balance, fairness, and equity in my diverse classes. More details in my [teaching philosophy](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/teaching-philosophy/) and [CV](https://www.raynaharris.com/teaching/).

## Goals for my CFTA Fellowship

- Increase engagement in the classroom
- Implement equitable grading practices

## Pedagogical and Curricular Changes

### 1. Pop-culture in Chemistry

Inspired by the "Equity Infused Teaching" lecture by Dr. Bruce Hoskins, I wrote three prompts from  the science in pop-culture activity in CHM 100, Dual Credit course. The students pulled a prompt from a beaker the were instructed to think of examples alone, with a partner, and in small groups (think, pair, share). 

- What songs reference real-life chemical elements or compounds?
- What TV shows or movies accurately depict chemical reactions?
- What TV shows or movies inaccurately depict chemical processes?

Students were very engaged. Then we segued into drawing chemical equation prompts from a beaker to work on homework problems in class. At the end of class, one student (who said they didn't want to be there upon arrival) said that the pop culture active was the perfect activity to get him to be excited about chemistry and participation.   

### 2. Grading Changes in Chemistry

Related the Dr. Bruce Hoskins, I actually wrote more multiple-choice questions for my chem class. I converted open-ended essay questions from hand-written homework assignements into a series of multiple choice questions for in-class assessment. My goal was the provide students with immediate feedback "write/wrong" on the quiz then using the homework to provide additional feedback on their calculations and logic.

### 3. Grading Changes in Anatomy & Physiology

Thanks to a discussion about grades with Heather Eubanks after her lecture on "Data Inquiry and Continuous Improvement", I made some grading changes to my Biology lab quizzes. My quizes have some built in attendance points, but at the beginning of the quarter I didn't provide any make-up alternatives. I've since additional alternatives for students for credit.

### 6. Body Scan Meditation

Body Scan Meditations are common yoga practices that raise self-awareness and calm the mind. I incorporated this (with a twist) as an icebreaker on Day 1 of BIO 305. I invited students to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths. First, they brought their attention to their feet and lower limbs, recalling the bones, joints, muscles, and blood vessels they studied in previous quarters. Then, they shifted their awareness to the pelvic and abdominal regions, followed by the chest and heart, and reflected on what they hoped to learn about the biological systems located there. Finally, they directed their attention to their heads. I encouraged them to acknowledge how much they are capable of learning and to set an intention for the quarter ahead. I believe this self-reflection, forward-thinking, and integration of concepts helps set a positive tone for the quarter.
