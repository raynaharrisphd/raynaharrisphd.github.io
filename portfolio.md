# Cultural Fluency Teaching Portfolio

Cultural fluency is the ability to understand and engage with people from different cultures, and culturally responsive teaching is a student-centered approach that recognizes and develops student's unique strengths. This teaching portfolio was prepared as part of the Cultural Fluency Teaching Academy in 2024-2025 at Lake Tahoe Community College.
