# Cultural Fluency Teaching Academy (CFTA) Portfolio


Hi! I'm Rayna. I'm from a small town in East Texas surrounded by lakes and pine trees, but I now live in Alpine Meadows. I hold a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and a B.S. in Biochemistry from The University of Texas at Austin. I have nearly 20 years of experience teaching courses in biology, chemistry, computer science, with some experience teaching Spanish and yoga The Courage Project and Tahoe Flow Arts & Fitness.

I believe learning should be goal-oriented, accessible to all, measurable through assessment, and fun. You can read [my teaching philosophy](https://www.raynaharris.com/philosophy/) and [my CV](https://www.raynaharris.com/teaching/) to learn more. This portfolio highlights the impact of the Courageous Faculty Teaching Alliance (CFTA) on my approach, particularly in the **Anatomy & Physiology (BIO 204 and 205)** and **Introduction to General Chemistry for Dual High School and College Credit (CHM 100)** courses.

## Goals for my CFTA Fellowship

- Increase engagement in the classroom and laboratory
- Implement equitable grading practices

## Course Motto

<img src="/images/motto.png" alt="review" width="90%" align="center"/>


In chemistry, the principle of "structure determine function" means that the arrangement of atoms and bonds within a molecule determines its chemical and physical properties and how it interacts with other molecules. In biology, anatomy is the study of body structure and physiology is the study of the function of cells and organ systems. In pedagogy, changes to the structure of the course may lead to differences in learning outcomes. 

## Pedagogical and Curricular Changes

### 1. Pop-culture in Chemistry

Inspired by the "Equity Infused Teaching" lecture by Dr. Bruce Hoskins, I wrote three prompts from  the science in pop-culture activity in CHM 100, Dual Credit course. The students pulled a prompt from a beaker the were instructed to think of examples alone, with a partner, and in small groups (think, pair, share). Students were very engaged. Then we segued into drawing chemical equation prompts from a beaker to work on homework problems in class. At the end of class, one student (who said they didn't want to be there upon arrival) said that the pop culture active was the perfect activity to get him to be excited about chemistry and participation.

### 2. Grading Changes in Chemistry

Related to the Dr. Bruce Hoskins lecture, I created additional multiple-choice questions for my chemistry class. I changed some open-ended essay questions from handwritten homework assignments into a series of multiple-choice questions for in-class assessments. My goal was to offer students immediate feedback on their quiz performance, indicating whether their answers were correct or incorrect. I then used the homework assignments to provide more detailed feedback, focusing on their calculations and logical reasoning.

### 3. Grading Changes in Anatomy & Physiology

Thanks to a discussion about grades with Heather Eubanks, I made adjustments to the grading structure of my Biology lab quizzes. My quizzes now have built-in make-up alternatives to ensure students have the opportunity to earn credit following an absense.

### 4. Caveat to Group-Work: Some Love It, Others Don't

### 6. Body Scan Meditation

Body Scan Meditations are common yoga practices that raise self-awareness and calm the mind. I incorporated this (with a twist) as an icebreaker on Day 1 of BIO 305. I invited students to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths. First, they brought their attention to their feet and lower limbs, **recall what you learned** about bones, joints, muscles, and blood vessels they studied in previous quarters. Then, they shifted their awareness to the pelvic and abdominal regions, followed by the chest and heart, and **visualize what you hope to learn** about the digestive, reproductive, and respiratory systems. Finally, they directed their attention to their heads. I encouraged them to acknowledge how much they are capable of learning and to **set an intention** for the quarter ahead. I believe this self-reflection, forward-thinking, and integration of concepts helps set a positive tone for the quarter.
