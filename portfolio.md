# Cultural Fluency Teaching Portfolio

Cultural fluency is the ability to understand and engage with people from different cultures, and culturally responsive teaching is a student-centered approach that recognizes and develops student's unique strengths. 

This teaching portfolio was prepared as part of the Cultural Fluency Teaching Academy in 2024-2025 at Lake Tahoe Community College. 

## Goals

- Increase engagement in Chemistry (CHM 100)
- Improve grading for Anatomy & Physiology (BIO 204)
