I"Ô<p>Today I attended <a href="https://indieweb.org/2019/Austin">IndieWebCamp Austin 2019</a>. IndieWebCamps are two days events for web creators to meet up to share ideas, improve their personal websites, and build upon each otherâ€™s creations. After a morning keynote, all the attendees (there were about 20 of us) gave a short demo of some of our web creations.</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> was something that struck me as immediately useful. It is a lightweight, text-based approach to terminal recording. Because itâ€™s text-based, people watching the screencast can <em>copy the text from the terminal!</em> I had to try it out.</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/docs/getting-started">Getting started</a> was pretty straightforward. I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install asciinema</code> to install it. Unfortunately, the record command, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asciinema rec</code>, returned an erro, but (luckily) there was a <a href="https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues/260">GitHub issue</a> with a solution! I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew postinstall python3</code>, and it worked! I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asciinema rec</code> to start a screen recording. I chose to follow a few of the commands in the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html">Software Carpentry Unix Shell Lesson on navigating files and directories</a>, which only goes into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man</code>. Once I typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> to end the recording, instructions for how to post to the web were printed directly on my screen. Then I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asciinema auth</code> to authentic myself as a user so that my videos could be stored on the web.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>
