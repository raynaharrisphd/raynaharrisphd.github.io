<p>Weâ€™re inviting Carpentries folks of all stripes â€” from new fans to veteran community-members, from all disciplines, near and far â€” to join us for CarpentryCon West! Weâ€™ve got housing and space for <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/">DIBSI 2018</a>, our annual bioinformatics summer institute, so weâ€™ve set aside <strong>Friday evening through Sunday morning, June 29-July 1</strong>, for a Carpentries gathering in sunny Davis, California. Things you can expect to find include:</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
