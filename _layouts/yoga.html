<h1> Yoga </h1>


<p> After daydreaming about teaching yoga for years, I finally pursued and received my 200-Hour Hatha Teacher Yoga certification in January 2024 at Palisades Yoga in North Lake Tahoe. My yoga classes flow through poses and synchronize the breath with movement and music in a playful way that builds physical strength and encourages mindfulness. I love teaching yoga outside where you can feel the warmth of the sun and the cool breeze of the wind on your skin as you practice.  </p>

<p> Below is a list and brief descriptions of all the yoga classes I have taught. Click the links for detailed descriptions of each class with images of poses and accompanying playlists.</p>
