When I was like 20 and in college, I wanted a PhD because I thought that I needed to be a Professor to teach biology anywhere in the world. But in the process of obtaining my PhD, I gave lectures and taught workshops all over the world, so I achieved that goal, AND I realized that being a Professor didn't involve as much teaching or the lifestyle I wanted. I'm learning that there are many opportunities for teaching outside academia that you can do anywhere and on your own time.

I've been practiced yoga infrequently for about 20 years, regularly during my last year of graduate school. I daydreamed of becoming a SUP Yoga Instructor, but I put that idea on the back burner and focus on getting a "real job". I thought I had to chose science or yoga, but now I think the two are quite complementary. 

There are some distinct differences between teaching science and teaching yoga. I love that there is no grading in yoga rather that students are in control of their engagements and progress. I love that yoga is immediately beneficial in that the act of practicing is good for one's body and mind, regardless of wether or not they learned something or gained a new skill that is useful to their future career.

Openly sharing teaching materials and project outputs was really important to me during grad school and my post doc. I always make websites to provide students and the public open access to all the teaching materials. So, for my first two yoga classes, I made posts with the names and images of each pose as well as the corresponding playlist (see [Friday Mountaintop Yoga](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/yoga-friday/) and [Saturday Lakeside Yoga](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/yoga-saturday/)) to share with the event organizers and playlists.

I learned how to make websites as a volunteer for Software Carpentry, and I learned how to develop lesson and create a welcoming classroom environments for students. I still some of these approaches today. Like, here is an example outline of a Software Carpentry lesson on UNIX and and outline of my beach yoga class. Both start with one big theme that is broken down into sections with relevant exercises. 


Some yoga class follow this flow: intention, opening stretch, standing poses, balancing poses, floor work, inversions, and relaxation. When designing a yoga class, I start with this framework (or some variation). Then I decided on a pose or series of poses for each section that will fit with the overall theme, location, and length of the class. After I tentatively decide on sequences of poses, I choose songs that have a nice beat for synchronizing the breath. Then I assemble the songs into a playlist and ensure that it matches the pace and length of each section and the whole calss. It helps me pace myself so that I don't rush and gives the practitioners time to explore each pose. During a really good yoga class, I will find myself thinking "remember this song that goes with this pose", but then I forget completely. I hope that people who come to my yoga classes use these links to find their favorite songs and poses.

I have a tendency to speak very fast when I'm at the front of a classroom or large audience. I'll plan for a lecture to take 45 minutes, but I'll deliver it in 20. I think it could be fun in the future to design a lecture that is timed to a specific playlist. This way, you could set specific songs for each part of your class, perhaps following a structure like: welcome, background, assessment, more info, activity, even more info, synthesis, closing. Music allows you to keep track of time and control pace with out using a clock, and it might improve students engagement.

I regularily use html, markdown, github actions, conda, css, bash, and other tools to maintain my website, and I use R to make graphs of budgets, grades, weather patterns, and more for fun and for work. I am so grateful that I learned many programing languages of the past decade. I did two-factor authenticate myself out of my old GitHub account, so now I have a new [GitHub account](https://github.com/raynaharrisphd)and a [new website](https://www.raynaharris.com/). Luckily, I have copies of the important ones, and most are public and easily accessible.
