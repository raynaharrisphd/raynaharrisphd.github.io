title: "Tahoe Flow - Yinyasa Yoga"
date: 2024-10-20
time: "9:30 - 10:30 AM" 
excerpt: "Yinyasa yoga is a hybrid class that combines elements of yin and vinyasa yoga. The class begins with restorative postures to stretch the fascia (a thin layer of connective tissue that supports the body's organs). Then, we warm the body with subtle movements and incorporate sun salutations and standing poses to build strength, flexibility, and balance. This is a relaxed flow class appropriate for all levels and abilities. Yinyasa will leave you feeling calm and energized."
