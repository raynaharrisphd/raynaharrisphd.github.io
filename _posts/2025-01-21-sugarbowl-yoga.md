excerpt: "This 15-minute yoga class is part 1 of a 4-part 60-minute yoga class at SportHaus at Sugar Bowl. Part 1 is focused on grounding, meditating, and gentle stretching to prepare the mind, body, and spirit for the deeper stretches later in the class. The practice begins with a gratitude meditation focusing on people, places, and experiences. The practice ends with Sun Salutation A (Surya Namaskar) with affirmations to link the mind to the body and the spirit or breath. The full sequence of poses is listed below along with a YouTube video to follow along."

## Logic

Yoga yokes mind, body and spirit. The following sections of the yoga class illustrate the various combinations.

Gratitude mediation - mind and spirit <br>
Body scan with massage - mind and body <br>
Warm-up stretch - body and spirit <br>
Sun salutation (_Surya Namaskar_) with affirmations - mind, body, and spirit <br>

Mindful control of the breath (_pranayama_)  allows us to clear the mind and calm the body.
