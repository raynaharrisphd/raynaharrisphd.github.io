Notes: The playlist start with 2 minutes of silence for a brief class introduction. The song "Joy" is meant to be played while yogis rest in Savasana. Nina Simone's song "Feeling Good" and Bob Marlesy's song accompany the supine asanas and heart open asanas, respectively. The half and low lunge slations can be peformed during the song Colors, with an emphasis on inhaling and exhaling on the 8 count. Be sure to shake a little after completing a Sun Salutaiotn with Warrior I pose while listening to James Brown. The upbeat "Strawberry Letter 23" is perfect for flowing between warrior II varations and goddess pose, and the slower-pacess happiness song offers a chance to pause in stillness and examine the balanced nature of life. Finally, low frequence sounds are played are used to future calm the mind, body, and spirit for relatation and meditation.
