excerpt: "In this class you'll enjoy a series of long-held, passive floor poses for deep stretching and relaxation. Our yin yoga classes work deep into the tissues of the body – ligaments, joints, bones, the fascia. The room is gently heated and music is used to create the perfect environment for you to relax the mind and the body. Open to all levels."
