excerpt: "In this class you'll enjoy a series of long-held, passive floor poses for deep stretching and relaxation. Our yin yoga classes work deep into the tissues of the body – ligaments, joints, bones, the fascia. The room is gently heated and music is used to create the perfect environment for you to relax the mind and the body. Open to all levels."

_Notes:_ Before class began, I played the first two songs as a gentle six-minute buffer while students settled in. During Kusangi, I introduced myself, shared the intention for our yin practice, and invited everyone to say their name and one thing they were grateful for. From there, each song supported a specific asana, with poses held for about one to two minutes on each side. Savasana lasted around six minutes and included a loving-kindness meditation. We closed class during the song 'Om' by Hippie Sabotage. All in all, it felt like a grounded, nourishing class that unfolded just the way it needed to.
