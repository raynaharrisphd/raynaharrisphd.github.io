Notes: The first two songs and the last songs are a buffer around the class. The first two songs are a 6 minute buffer; I start the playlist 3 minutes before class is supposed to start, then I begin 3 minutes late. During the welcome I introduce myself and the class then I ask their names and one things they are grateful for. Then, I sync the poses to the music, aiming for 1 - 2 minute holds for each pose on each side. The Savasana was about 6 minutes long and included a loving-kindness meditation. I like to send with the om song, because that way students hear it but they don't have to sing it if they don't want to. All in all, I think it was a fun class.
