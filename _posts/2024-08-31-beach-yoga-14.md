## Notes

After class a few people stuck around to do headstands and I got some great photos. Then, a dad came up to me and handed me a little cash tip. He said he practices regularly (I could tell), but he can almost never get his family to go with him, but they really loved my class (e.g. the music, the setting, the playfulness), and he was sure it was the experience they needed to start going as a family more often. Yea!
