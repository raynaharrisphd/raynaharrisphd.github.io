## Sequence of Asanas 


The same playlist is used for both clases and both classes have a similar beginning and end, but the 8:30 vinyasa class is more vigorous and incorporates more poses or asanas than the slower 7:30 class. Each class follows an arc of energy and intensity: Open Awareness > Warm-up > Sun Salutation > Standing Poses > Balancing poses > Inversions > Twists > Relaxation

## Post-Class Notes

I taught 2 privates today, and they were great!  I made one playlist and outlined two classes, one slower and one more vigorous class. This worked great because the first guest was a very experienced yogi and the second guest was a first-timer. I felt a lot more prepared and confident teaching 1 person today than in June when I first started. So fun!!
