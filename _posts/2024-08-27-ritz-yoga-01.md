title: "Yoga at the Ritz 1 - Feeling Good "
date: 2024-08-27
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "This is my first time teaching at the Ritz, marking the beginning of my Fall Yoga Flow Series. Today's classes are all about starting the day feeling good."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Sequence of Asanas 


The same playlist is used for both clases and both classes have a similar beginning and end, but the 8:30 vinyasa class is more vigorous and incorporates more poses or asanas than the slower 7:30 class. Each class follows an arc of energy and intensity: Open Awareness > Warm-up > Sun Salutation > Standing Poses > Balancing poses > Inversions > Twists > Relaxation

## Post-Class Notes

I taught 2 privates today, and they were great!  I made one playlist and outlined two classes, one slower and one more vigorous class. This worked great because the first guest was a very experienced yogi and the second guest was a first-timer. I felt a lot more prepared and confident teaching 1 person today than in June when I first started. So fun!!
