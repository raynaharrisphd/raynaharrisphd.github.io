## Sequence of Asanas 


Open Awareness > Warm-up > Sun Salutation > Standing Poses > Balancing poses > Inversions > Twists > Relaxation   

The same playlist is used for both clases and both classes have a similar beginning and end, but the 8:30 vinyasa class is more vigorous and incorporates more poses or asanas than the slower 7:30 class. Each class follows an arc of energy and intensity: Open Awareness > Warm-up > Sun Salutation > Standing Poses > Balancing poses > Inversions > Twists > Relaxation
