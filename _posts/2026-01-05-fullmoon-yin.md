excerpt: "In Mountain Lotus Yin classes you'll enjoy a series of long-.held, passive floor poses for deep stretching and relaxation. Yin yoga works deep into the tissues of the body – ligaments, joints, bones, the fascia. The room is gently heated and music is used to create the perfect environment for you to relax the mind and the body. Open to all levels."

All poses are accomanpied by blankes and bolsters and held for about 3 minutes each. 

Rather than create a brand new playlist, I used a previous spotify playlist for this class.
