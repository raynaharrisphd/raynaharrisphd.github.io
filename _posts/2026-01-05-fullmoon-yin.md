excerpt: "In Mountain Lotus Yin classes you'll enjoy a series of long-.held, passive floor poses for deep stretching and relaxation. Yin yoga works deep into the tissues of the body – ligaments, joints, bones, the fascia. The room is gently heated and music is used to create the perfect environment for you to relax the mind and the body. Open to all levels."

Inspiration for this class comes from yesterday's full moon and the book 
_"Restorative Yoga for Beginners - Gentle Poses for Relaxation and Healing"_ by Julia Clark.
Here is the outlined sequence of poses I incorporated into class,
with the props in parentheses (blankets/bolsters) plus instructor notes. 
All poses are accomanpied by blankes and bolsters and held for about 3 minutes each. 


* Meditation Pose _(seated on bolster)_ + Welcome + Gratitude
* Relaxation Pose _(bolster under knees)_ + Breathwork
* Reclined Buttefly _(feet on bolster)_ + Full Body Scan Meditation

</div>

The next three are performed like a pendulum from 
right side bend, childs pose, right half frog to
left half frog, childs pose, left side bend. 

* Side Bend _(boster under chest, blanket under head and neck)_   
* Child's Pose _(boster under chest)_ + Intension Setting
* Half Frog _(boster under chest, blanket under knee)_

</div>

The final sequence involves one seated pose, inversions, and twists
before closing with final relaxation and meditation. 

* Straddle Forward Fold _(blocks and bolster under chest)_   
* Legs Up the Bolster _(blocks and bolster under legs)_  
* Spinal Twistst _(bolster legs)_
* Reclined Buttefly _(feet on bolster)_ + Loving Kindness Meditation
* Meditation Pose + Closing

Rather than create a brand new playlist, I used a previous spotify playlist for this class.
