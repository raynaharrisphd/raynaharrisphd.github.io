This is a 4 minute video tutorial for adjusting notification settings.

Link to YouTube: [https://youtu.be/4vhWJ_lgG0c](https://youtu.be/4vhWJ_lgG0c)

I recommend watching it a 2x speed. 

It has three parts. 
1. Exploring an organizational dashboard.
1. Exploring repository insights
1. Changing individual and global repository settings

I hope you find it useful!
