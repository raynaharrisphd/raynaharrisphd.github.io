I practiced yoga regularly during my last year of graduate school. I daydreamed of becoming a SUP Yoga Instructor, but I put that idea on the back burner. I thought I had to chose science or yoga, but now I think the two are quite complementary. Much of the biology and pedaogy is shared, but there are disctinct differences. I love that there is no grading in yoga rather that students are in control of their engagements and progress. 

Openly sharing teaching materials and project outputs was really important to me during grad school and my post doc. I always make websites to provide students and the public open access to all the teaching materials. So, for my first two yoga classes, I made posts with the names and images of each pose as well as the corresponding playlist (see [Friday Mountaintop Yoga](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/yoga-friday/) and [Saturday Lakeside Yoga](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/yoga-saturday/)) to share with the event organizers and playlists.

I've been practicing yoga for at least a decade, and I only recently realized that many yoga class follow this flow: intention, opening stretch, standing poses, balancing poses, floor work, inversions, and relaxation. When designing a yoga class, I start with this framework (or some variation). Then I decided on a pose or series of poses for each section that will fit with the overall theme, location, and length of the class. After I tentatively decide on sequences of poses, I choose songs that have a nice beat for synchronizing the breath. Then I assemble the songs into a playlist and ensure that it matches the pace and length of each section and the whole calss. It helps me pace myself so that I don't rush and gives the practitioners time to explore each pose.  Here is one example of [a floor work sequences](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/yoga-friday/) that goes well with the song [Mambo by Glass Animals](https://open.spotify.com/track/63OC8cNa4ZnFB3bbvbWCOc?si=cf52aa5d34444dd2). During a really good yoga class, I will find myself thinking "remember this song that goes with this pose", but then I forget completely. I hope that people who come to my yoga classes use these links to find their favorite songs and poses.

I have a tendency to speak very fast when I'm at the front of a classroom or large audience. I'll plan for a lecture to take 45 minutes, but I'll deliver it in 20. I think it could be fun in the future to design a lecture that is timed to a specific playlist. This way, you could set specific songs for each part of your class, perhaps following a structure like: welcome, background, assessment, more info, activity, even more info, synthesis, closing. Music allows you to keep track of time and control pace with out using a clock, and it might improve students engagement.

I regularily use html, markdown, github actions, conda, css, bash, and other tools to maintain my website, and I use R to make graphs of budgets, grades, weather patterns, and more for fun and for work. I am so grateful that I learned many programing languages of the past decade. I did two-factor authenticate myself out of my old GitHub account, so now I have a new [GitHub account](https://github.com/raynaharrisphd)and a [new website](https://www.raynaharris.com/). Luckily, I have copies of the important ones, and most are public and easily accessible. 

It's funny, I used to thing becoming a Professor was the path to being a teacher anywhere in the world. But, I got to teach all over the world while getting my PhD. I'm learning that there are many opportunities for teaching outside academia that you can do anywhere and on your own time.
