###  3-Part Breath (Dirga Pranayama) (3 min)

Slowly come to a seat and place a bolster lengthwise on your mat, with the narrow end touching your hip. Glide into Grounding Spinal Twist Pose with your chest and left side of your face on the bolster and your arms at your side.

After 1 minute, return your breathing to normal, then switch sides and repeat. 

### Affirmation Meditation (6 min)

Gently come to a seat and place a block under the top of bolster to create a slight incline. Bring the base of your spin to the edge of the bolser. Place a towel under your knees and slower lower your back and head onto the bolster for supported Heart Pose. 

For this affirmation meditation, I invite you to silently repeat these phrases in your head. 

- I am grounded in this moment.
- I am connected to the earth.
- I am present with each breath.
- I am softening into presence.
- I am where I need to be.
- I am enough exactly as I am.
- I am safe in my body.
- I am guided by clarity.
- I am letting go of what doesn't serve me.
- I am strong, steady, and soft.
- I am open to receiving love.
- I am light in my heart and body.
- I am attuned to the rhythm of now.
- I am grateful for this breath.
- I am centered and at peace.
- I am whole, just as I am.
- I am aligned with ease and purpose.

Take a moment to silently create and recite your own personal affirmation statements, or repeat any affirmations that spoke to you.

Maybe one phrase from this practice feels like yours—take it with you today as a silent mantra.”
