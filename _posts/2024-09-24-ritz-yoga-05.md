title: "Yoga at the Ritz 5 - Fallen Star"
date: 2024-09-24
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "This class centers around the 'fallen star' or 'fallen triangle' pose as the peak pose."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Notes

No one showed up for the first class, but two women showed up for the second. They had done a lot of hiking the past few days, so we focused on lengthening and strengthening. I had them do Warrior II facing each other and say out like what they were feeling (like I am planning to do for the [Performance Summit](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/performance-summit/) tomorrow). They had a lot of fun with that. During the full body scan one of them exclaimed that her shoulder didn't hurt for the first time in days. Yea!
