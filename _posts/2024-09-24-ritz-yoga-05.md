## Notes

No one showed up for the first class, but two women showed up for the second. They had done a lot of hiking the past few days, so we focused on lengthening and strengthening. I had them do Warrior II facing each other and say out like what they were feeling (like I am planning to do for the [Performance Summit](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/performance-summit/) tomorrow). They had a lot of fun with that. During the full body scan one of them exclaimed that her shoulder didn't hurt for the first time in days. Yea!
