## Overview

Yoga yokes mind, body and spirit. The following sections of the yoga class illustrate the various combinations.

Gratitude mediation - mind and spirit <br>
Body scan with massage - mind and body <br>
Warm-up stretch - body and spirit <br>
Sun salutation (_Surya Namaskar_) with affirmations - mind, body, and spirit <br>

Mindful control of the breath (_pranayama_)  allows us to clear the mind and calm the body.

## Music

Since I taught this yoga class in combination with two other yoga teachers, I didn't design a playlist because I thought the change over would be too difficult. However, my fellow Yogi, Meghan Fuss was in the audience and she took charge of the music for us and queued this lovely playlist.
