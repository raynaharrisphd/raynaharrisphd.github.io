title: "Yoga at the Ritz 7 * Sun Salutations with Affirmations"
date: 2024-10-04
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "I used today's class to beta test a flow I'm working on for a private group yoga class next Saturday. The sequence is pretty similar to most of my classes with breath-work, warm-up, standing poses, inversions, and relaxation. However, this time I added what I call 'Sun Salutations with Affirmations'. We make a list of 10 affirmations then say them outloud with each new asana in the Sun Salutation."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breath-work to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes will typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretch, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. The are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Notes

For today's class I beta tested [the sequence](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/beach*yoga*birthday/) I am preparing for a private beach yoga session on October 12. It went really great. For the 7:30 am class a friend who works at the Ritz showed up, so I felt comfortable testing it on her. I was able to work out a few kinks and decided to rearrange a few songs in the playlist. 

For the 8:30 class, no one showed up initially, but then a woman came in to do yoga on here own, but after chatting for a bit, I convinced her to let me teach her a few things. We did the Sun Salutations with Affirmations together, and she loved it. She took a photo of the board to keep for herself and to share with her yoga teacher friend. She was there with her family for a 3*day mountain marathon race to bring awareness to children with disabilities.
