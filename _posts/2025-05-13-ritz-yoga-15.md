Intension setting: ‚ÄúI am exactly where I need to be.‚Äù  

### Breath Awareness 

Begin to bring awareness to the natural breath.   
Notice the inhale and exhale, the rise and fall of your chest and belly.  
Let your breath be your anchor to the present moment.    

### Box Breathing  

Inhale for 4 ‚Äì Hold for 4 ‚Äì Exhale for 4 ‚Äì Hold for 4. Repeat.  

Return to natural breath afterward and notice the effects. 

###  3-Part Breath  

Slowly come to a seat and place a bolster lengthwise on your mat, with the narrow end touching your hip. Glide into Grounding Spinal Twist Pose with your chest and left side of your face on the bolster and your arms at your side.  

Inhale deeply into your belly, chest, and colar bones then exhale completely. Your breath is slow, full, and grounded.

After 1 minute, return your breathing to normal, then switch sides and repeat. 

### Affirmation Meditation  

Gently come to a seat and place a block under the top of bolster to create a slight incline. Bring the base of your spin to the edge of the bolser. Place a towel under your knees and slower lower your back and head onto the bolster for supported Heart Pose. 

For this affirmation meditation, I invite you to silently repeat these phrases in your head. 

- I am grounded in this moment.
- I am connected to the earth.
- I am present with each breath.
- I am where I need to be.
- I am enough exactly as I am.
- I am safe in my body.
- I am strong, steady, and soft.
- I am open to receiving love.
- I am grateful for this breath.
- I am aligned with ease and purpose.

Take a moment to silently create and recite your own personal affirmation statements, or repeat any affirmations that spoke to you.
