- **Loving Kindness Meditation**

**Nourish the Seeds:** Seeds hold potential for new life within their small structures. By without the proper nourishment (the right amount of water, light, and nutrients) a seed will not yield life. Today, focus on something you want to accomplish (a creative idea, a side project, or a long-term goal) and consider what resources and support you need to succeed. Commit to your focus and repeat the phrase "I will nourish what I want to see grow."    

**Loving Kindess Meditation:** May I/you/we be happy/healthy/safe.
