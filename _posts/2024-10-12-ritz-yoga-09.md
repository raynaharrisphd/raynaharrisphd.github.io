title: "Yoga at the Ritz 9 - Restorative"
date: 2024-10-12
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "This yoga class stars slow with restorative poses then increases intensity with vinyasas and standing poses before cooling down and resting in Savasana."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."
