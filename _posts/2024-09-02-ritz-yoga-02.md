date: 2024-09-02
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "This yoga class focuses on deep core activation through strength and conditioning as well as rest and restoration. It is designed to foster a balanced and happy equilibrium to start your holiday."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Inspiration

The "Core & Restore" class is typically taught by a different Tahoe Flow Instructor, but they are on vacation, so I'm subbing. I watched this Yoga with Adriene video for inspiration and preparation.

## Notes

Well, I accidentally left my phone at home, so I wasn't able to play my playlist. Oops! But, it worked out okay! I wrote out the sequence I had planned on a whiteboard, and I used the clock to keep track of time. For the 7:30 class, I had four students, and we did everything as planned except for the situps. For the 8:30 class, one woman showed up, and she said she loved the restorative class from the day before, so I slowed down the pace, omitted some of the poses, and added bolsters for support. Afterwards, she said she really appreciated the space for silence, something that is very rare in her life. So, yea!
