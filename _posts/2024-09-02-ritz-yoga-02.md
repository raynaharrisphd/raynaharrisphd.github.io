## Inspiration

The "Core & Restore" class is typically taught by a different Tahoe Flow Instructor, but they are on vacation, so I'm subbing. I watched this Yoga with Adriene video for inspiration and preparation.

## Notes

Well, I accidentally left my phone at home, so I wasn't able to play my playlist. Oops! But, it worked out okay! I wrote out the sequence I had planned on a whiteboard, and I used the clock to keep track of time. For the 7:30 class, I had four students, and we did everything as planned except for the situps. For the 8:30 class, one woman showed up, and she said she loved the restorative class from the day before, so I slowed down the pace, omitted some of the poses, and added bolsters for support. Afterwards, she said she really appreciated the space for silence, something that is very rare in her life. So, yea!
