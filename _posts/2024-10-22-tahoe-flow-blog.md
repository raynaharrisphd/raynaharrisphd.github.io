excerpt: "Have you ever wanted to pause during a yoga class and write down the name of a song that is playing or the poses you just practiced? I know I have, that's why I like to share my sequences and playlist."

Before I started teaching yoga, I taught computer science workshops for about five years. One of our standard teaching practices was to make a website for the workshop that contains all the necessary instructions, files, and useful researchers. This was a valuable resource for students and teachers during and after the workshop. This practice of making all the educational resources freely available is called "open source education".

When I started teaching yoga, I wanted to bring a similar approach to my 
yoga classes. So, for every class I teach, I write a blog post that includes details about when and where, an general description, the theme of class, and outline of the sequence of poses, and a link to the Spotify playlist. 

My classes tend to follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, balancing poses, inversions, twists, grounding poses, and relaxation. I specifically chose songs that fit the energy level of each to make my playlist. For instance, I usually start with songs without words during the welcome and meditation. When we start moving our bodies, I like to choose songs with lyrics that match the poses or beats that flow nicely with the breath. 

Here is one example of an outline of poses and the coreponsing playlist from a [mindful beach yoga class](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/beach-yoga-13/).
