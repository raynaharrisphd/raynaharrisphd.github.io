Have you ever wanted to pause during a yoga class and write down the name of a song that is playing or the poses you just practiced? I know I have. But that would be weird (right?), so instead I try to hold it in my memory, but I often forget. 

I like to provide people who come to my yoga classes an outline of the yoga sequence I have planned as well as a link to the Spotify playlist that corresponds to the yoga flow. Sometimes I print physical copies, but I always write a blog post so that there is an easily accessible digital copy.
