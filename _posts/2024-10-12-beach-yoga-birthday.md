date: 2024-10-04
excerpt: "This is a private class for a group of celebrating a friend's 40th birthday. They requested a light flow ending with a nice restorative savasana. The class begins with writing 12 affirmation statements, breath-work, and a birthday meditation. After a brief warm-up, we do sun salutations and add in the 12 affirmations statements as mantras. This is followed by a series of standing poses to build strength, flexibility, and balance. After a little core-work, we cool down, relax, and end with a juicy savasana."
