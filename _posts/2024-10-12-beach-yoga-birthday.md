title: "Yoga on the Beach - Birthday Yoga"
date: 2024-10-12
excerpt: "This is a private class for a group of celebrating a friend's 40th birthday. They requested a light flow ending with a nice restorative savasana. The class begins with writing 12 affirmation statements, breath-work, and a birthday meditation. After a brief warm-up, we do sun salutations and add in the 12 affirmations statements as mantras. This is followed by a series of standing poses to build strength, flexibility, and balance. After a little core-work, we cool down, relax, and end with a juicy savasana."

## Birthday Meditation Script

_Adapted from the [Women's Meditation Network](https://womensmeditationnetwork.com/happy-birthday-guided-meditation-mfw/) Guided Birthday Meditation._

Today we pause to honor,
The person that you are,
The journey you have taken,
Has brought you oh so far.

PAUSE…

The ups and downs,
And everything in between,
[Have evolved you into]
A luminous queen.

PAUSE…

The lessons from the failures,
And pain from all the nos,
Have made you quite resilient,
Kept you [on] your toes.

PAUSE…

The people that have loved you,
And those you’ve held [so] dear.
Have [pried] your heart [wide] open,
And expanded your love past fear.

PAUSE…

Think about the [woman] you were,
Just one year ago.
[You are] so much wiser now,
The year has [brought about a] glow.

PAUSE…
You may not be where you want,
You may have shifts to make.
That’s part of what makes you you,
Always growing for your own sake.

PAUSE…

So on this special day,
Feel the love [and light] within you [shine].
[And know you warm the hearts of others],
[Just like a beautiful ray of sunshine].

LONG PAUSE…

So breathe in deep,
And breathe out long.
[Accept] yourself [in the moment],
Right here and now is where you belong.

PAUSE…

[Alive and breathing],
Celebrate this chance to be,
Fully and completely you,
Wild, magical, and free.

PAUSE…

Happy 40th Birthday, Kateryna.


## Bookmark

I made a little bookmark for the participants so they could write down their affirmations and either keep it in a journal or post it on a fridge for future reference.
