excerpt: "For this class, I included introductions and asked participants to share their name, one thing they are grateful for, and their favorite post. The answers were awesome and included tree, pigeon, and child's pose as well as any back-bendy things. I bolded each favorite pose in the class outline below. Scroll down for the playlist."
