## Notes 

I had two guests in the 7:30 class and one in the 8:30 class. I did the sequence listed above for the 7:30 because they looked like they were ready for a challange but its also supposed to be a slower class. For the 8:30, class, one of the students stayed and we did some restorative poses with bolster and no music. It was a great Tuesday.
