date: 2024-09-03
time: "7:30 - 9:30 AM" 
excerpt: "This yoga class is all about feelin' good. It is a full body workout that is designed to lengthen, strengthen, and balance."
description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Notes 

I had two guests in the 7:30 class and one in the 8:30 class. I did the sequence listed above for the 7:30 because they looked like they were ready for a challange but its also supposed to be a slower class. For the 8:30, class, one of the students stayed and we did some restorative poses with bolster and no music. It was a great Tuesday.
