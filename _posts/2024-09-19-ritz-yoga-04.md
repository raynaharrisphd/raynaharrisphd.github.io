## Notes 

I had one guest for the 7:30 class, and she really like the flow which I did tailor to her request even thought I was based on the sequence I'm planning for the [Performance Summit](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/performance-summit/) later this month. She commented on having arthritis and shared which poses caused discomfort and relief, which was very informative. I also had one guest for the 8:30 class, but she wanted a more active flow, so I used this [Mindful Flow playlist and sequence](https://www.raynaharris.com/blog/ritz-yoga-03/).
