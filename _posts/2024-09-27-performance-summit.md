## Script

### Welcome (Brie?)

Dr Rayna Harris is biology professor and a yoga instructor with the Courage Project and Tahoe Flow Arts Fitness. She will lead today's yoga session

Yoga is a powerful to for connecting to the body through awareness. Mindful yoga can be defined as gentle stretching and strengthing with awareness of our breathing and the sensations that accompany shifting the body into various poses or postures or asanas. Ideally, mindful yoga is practiced without striving or forcing but with acceptance of our current state. 

The goal of this practice to is to developed greater awareness of our bodies rather than to push physical limits. It is important to take responsibility for you own body and do only what you are capable of. Feel free to skip any movements or poses that seem inappropriate for you body limits today. Pay full attention to the sensations your body is feeling and where you are feeling them. 

### Centering

Let's begin to a comfortable standing or seated position. You may close your eyes or leave them open slightly, and turn your attention inward. Take a deep breath in. As you exhale feel feel or your sit bones ground into the surface below you. Continue breathing. Place one hand on your belly and one hand on your hearth. Notice the sensation of your chest and belly expanding with each inhale and falling with each exhale. Deepen your breath by counting to five on your inhales and exhales. 

Lift your arms high over head for a big good morning stretch, then bring your hands together in front of your heart, palms touch. Take a moment to set and intension for your practice today, such as non-judgmentally listening to your body or being fully present with your thoughts. 

### Full Body Scan 

Now, we will perform a full body scan with the intension of noticing sensations, to acknowledge them and then let them go. Let's begin by directing our attention to your toes. Notice the sensations of contact with perhaps the floor or your shoes or the air. As you exhale, let the observation of those sensations go. Now shift your attention to the ball of your foot, the arch, and the heel. Whatever you notice, bring an attitude of acceptance. Now, shift your attention up the left to your ankles, calfs, and knees. What are you noticing here? Do you notice any tension or discomfort? As you exhale, let go of these observations. One your next inhale, direct your attention to your thighs and quads. What sensations do you notice? Exhale release. 

Bring your attention to.... then release the sensations with your exhale.
- hips and pelvic region 
- lower back and abdomen
- chest and shoulders
- biceps, triceps, and elbow
- forarm and writs
- hands and figures
- neck
- facial muscles
- the top of your head

Now, allow your focused attention to relax and expand throughout your entire body. As you breath, feel the hum of that that flows through us. Allow this moment to be exactly what it is. Take a deep breath. Invite subtle movement into your extremities. Open your eyes and return your attention to the world around you. 

### Warm-Up

Let's invite more movement to wake up and warm up the body. 

Inhale, lift your shoulders toward your ears, then exhale drop them, release any tension. Two more times. Now, let's do shoulder circles. As you inhale, lift your shoulder forward and up, and as you exhale send them backward and down. After two cycles, switch the direction, allowing your breath to guide the movement. Now, let's do neck circles. Lower your chin so that your nose it as 6 o'clock. As you inhale, imagine your nose tracing a clock, moving from 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock then 12 o'clock. Pause. As you exhale, your nose moves from 12 to 3 and back to 6. Repete that motion two more times, then reverse the direction to couter clockwise. 

Raise your arms to a cactus shape, elbows bent, palms forward. As you inhale, lift your gaze and arch your back for a _modified cow pose_. As you exhale, tuck your chin, round your back, and bring your elbows toward each other infront of your face for _modified cow pose_. Alternate between the poses, allowing the breath to guide the movement, and noticing any sensations that arise. Return to center. On your next inhale, twist to the left, pause, exhale return to center. On your next inhale, twist to the right, pause, exhale return to center. Noticing the sensations that arise from lengthening your side body and wringing out your insides. Lower your arms to your side. 
 
### Standing Practice 

Let's turn and face a partner. You should be able to see me out corner of you eye. We are going to invite some dialog so that you can share your observations and become aware of those of others. 

Lift the arm that is closest to me, so that you and your part are mirror images with one arm lifted. Stay here, or, if you you are standing, step back with the leg on the same side of the body as the lifted arm into _Warrior I pose_. Now, lift both arms. What sensations do you notice in this pose? What muscles feel strengthened what muscles feel lengthened? Say these out loud to your partner.  Inhale lengthen, exhale hinge at the waste and lean your chest forward to a 45 degree angle. Send your arms down and back so they are in the same plane as your back, palms face down. This is _Warrior 1 with airplane arms_. What sensations do you notice in this pose? What muscles feel strengthened what muscles feel lengthened? Say these out loud to your partner. Inhale lift your chest and your arms. Exhale step your back foot up to meet the front and bring your palms to touch at heart center. _Repeat on the other side._ 

On your inhale, lift both arms high in the sky, and on your exhale send them out wide so that your fingers are pointing to 3 and 9 o'clock. Stay here, or step toward me with the closet foot, opening your hips so that the front foot is pointed toward me and the back food is pointed toward your partner. Bend your front knee and come into _Warrior II_. What sensations do you notice in this pose? What muscles feel strengthened what muscles feel lengthened? Say these out loud to your partner. Now, hinge in the side body, brining armpit toward your knee. Your arms will move to 4 and 10 o'clock or maybe 6 and 12. This is side angle pose. What sensations do you notice in this pose? What muscles feel strengthened what muscles feel lengthened? Say these out loud to your partner. Inhale return to center. Exhale release. Inhale step your front foot to meet the back and bring your hands to heart center. _Repeat on the other side._ 

_Optional 1 leg Tadasana with Warrior III flow._

Inhale lift your arms and your gase up to the sky, exhale hinge at the waist and _forward fold_ over your legs, bending your knees as much as feel good, letting your hands drop toward the ground. What sensations do you notice in this pose? What muscles feel strengthened what muscles feel lengthened? What can you let go of in this pose? Maybe you grab your elbows and sway side to side. Maybe you shake your head yes and no. Inhale slowly role up one vertebra at a time to a comfortable upright position. 

### Closing

Gently close your eyes or soften your gase. Perform a _full body scan meditation_ on your own beginning with your attention on the toes and ending with your attention the crown of the head. Notice and sensations that arise and how they may have changed with this short yoga practice. 

Where ever you are, bring your attention to your heart center, and bring your palms to touch at heart center. The light in me acknowledges and honors the light in you. Thank you being here today to practice yoga and learn more about your body and mind and to share your experiences with this beautiful community. _Namaste_.
