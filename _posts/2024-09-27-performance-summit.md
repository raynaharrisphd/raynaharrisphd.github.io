excerpt: "A 30 minute mediation and yoga flow for mindful sport performance enhancement." 
description: "This interactive, experiential workshop will provide exposure to the educational content and mindfulness exercises that comprise a leading, evidence-informed, mental training program: Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement (Kaufman, Glass & Pineau, 2018). Participants will gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical and empirical basis of MSPE, factors relevant to its application across diverse populations and settings, as well as limitations of this research and future directions. Dr. Kaufman will present key strategies for integrating core mindfulness skills into practice, competition, and daily life. During a catered, working lunch, a moderated, multi-disciplinary panel will discuss factors related to sport performance from the sport science, coach, and athlete perspectives. Participants will gain hands-on, experiential instruction in MSPE concepts and practices via participation in an in-vivo, mindful yoga practice and a guided, mindful hike in the picturesque Olympic Valley."

## Mindful Yoga Flow
 
As part of the [2024 Lake Tahoe Performance Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2024-lake-tahoe-performance-summit-tickets-876987381867?utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing&utm-source=cp&aff=ebdsshcopyurl) I am teaching a 30 minute Mindful Yoga Flow that is inspired by the book [Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement](https://www.mindfulsportperformance.org/book). I have incorporated the script for mediation and breathing, but I have modified the suggested asanas to created a sequence with standing poses only. Below is an outline of the flow and the accompanying Spotify playlist.
