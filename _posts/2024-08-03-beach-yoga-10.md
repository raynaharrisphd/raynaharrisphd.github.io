## Feedback

It sprinkled during class, which was awesome, but then it started poring rain before we could do the Savasana. One older woman said she was trying to get back into exercise and the class was great. Another man told me I was a really good teacher. The most experienced yogi in the group told me she loved the playlist. It was a great class!
