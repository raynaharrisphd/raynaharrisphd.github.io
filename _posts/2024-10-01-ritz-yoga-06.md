## Spotify Playlist

Instead of using a Spotify playlist for this class, I defaulted to the spa music that was playing over the loudspeaker because it had a nice calming feel. But, I would've used this playlist if there hadn't been music.

## Notes 

I had one guest for the 7:30 class, and she said the class was exactly what she needed. She had been lifting weights a lot and need to focuses on stretching and listening to her body. The 8:30 class had two friends and they really enjoyed talking to each other during the warrior poses and noticing the similar and different sensations they had. I will keep incorporating the discussion in my classes.
