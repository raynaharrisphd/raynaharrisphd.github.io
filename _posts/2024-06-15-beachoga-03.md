This playlist starts with 20 minutes of music that I listen to while getting ready for class. If you are practicing at home, begin with a seated meditation during the song "Solar Plexus - Fire" and continue with intension setting, warm-up, sun salutations, back bends, inversions, breath of fire, grounding poses, and Savasana.
