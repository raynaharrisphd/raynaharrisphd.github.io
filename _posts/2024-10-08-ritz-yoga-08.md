description: "Yoga at Ritz is a fun class for all levels and ages with flowing poses and breathwork to build stability, flexibility, and mindfulness. These classes typically follow an arc of opening awareness, warm-up stretches, standing poses, balancing poses, inversions, grounding poses, and relaxation. There are two classes, one at 7:30 and one at 8:30. I adapt each class to the students who show up."

## Notes

I thought I was going to have a repeat guest in my class, so I wanted to do something different than Thursday, so I picked this inhale-exhale meditation as a centering activity. But, she didn't show. 

For the 7:30 class, a woman requested a hip-opening flow, so I made up the sequence above on the fly, based on previous classes, especially one I just happened to go to on Monday. For the 8:30 class, one of her coworkers was in the gym and I hustled him into letting me teach him a few breathing techniques and the Warrior poses.
