## Feedback

I always play the "JUMP" song at the end of my classes when its time to go for a cold plunge so that people will not be scared to jump in. The lyrics include this spoken verse:

>> You see here, kid
>> You gotta just go for it
>> Don't think about what comes after or what came before
>> You just gotta bend your knees, take a deep breath, and jump
>> And you might think,
>> What if I fall?
>> Well, what if you don't?
>> What if you fly?

Today, class went a little long because we has some play time where I opened the floor to student suggestions. They included headstand and modified triangle, which lead to side plank. Two students fell in, but the water was really warm and it was shallow, so everyone was having fun. I kept Savasana short because half were wet, but I played the "JUMP" song long enough for people to be able to meditate on those words. 

After class, on repeat student said to me, "my one piece of advice... your class is great, fun, welcoming... but I recommend that you just go for it. Don't be scared that we might fall in. We know what we signed up for, and it's okay if we fall in."

I love the full circle. I have been keeping my class simple so that know one falls in, but I think there is room to add more physically and mental challenging elements while still keeping to accessible and fun.
